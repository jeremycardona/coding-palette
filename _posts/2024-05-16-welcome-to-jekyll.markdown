# Welcome to coding palette!

The blog started as a sketch design I had in mind for a simple blog. After giving it thought I decided to give a step further and make mockups and a final prototype design of what I wanted this blog to look.  
  
Later on I explored options for making static websites, after all I needed was to host my blog posts and some other content I think it's appropriate for a personal website. So, what you're seeing is made using Jekyll as a static site generator and my design idea for a blog.
