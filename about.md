My name is Jeremy Cardona. I started my journey as a programmer since I was 16 years old when I found a book about web design in my school library. Since then I was curious about programming and when I graduated high school in 2014 I continued my studies in University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez campus where I majored in Computational sciences.  

This blog is about the code solving programming projects tasks. Blog posts are about my experience as a student in holberton coding school Puerto Rico!  
Besides programming I'm interested in user experience design.
